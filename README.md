# MKurt-LIA: Mechanical Fault Vibration Signal Measurement Scheme with Frequency Tracking Capability for Bearing Condition Monitoring

Even though a Lock-in Amplifier (LIA) can effectively detect weak signals buried in noise, its high accuracy depends on having an accurate reference frequency as prior knowledge. If the reference frequency has even a seemingly small error, the impact on the measurement results can be significant—this is the "double-edged sword" aspect of the LIA. This work provides the implementation of Mkurt-LIA. It uses Mkurt spectra to search for the most likely fault frequencies in the vibration signals of faulty bearings and employs the LIA to detect signal components at these frequencies. The results confirm that this frequency-tracking LIA measurement architecture outperforms the LIA measurement architecture that directly uses theoretical fault characteristic frequencies as the reference frequency.

I am not sure if GitHub allows uploading large data files, so I have provided a data download link here. This way, any interested user can directly run this Matlab script. Alternatively, you can place the discretized vibration signal data stored in CSV format in a self-created data folder.
